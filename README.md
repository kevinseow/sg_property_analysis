Analysing real estate prices in Singapore

Was part of my Masters course.

Summary:
Using hedonic regression, spatial econometric methods and property price index construction, this paper explores possible investment opportunities to help the retail investor.  The paper finds that proximity to train lines generally commanded a price premium, particularly for more established lines. In addition, the capitalisation of new train line development into property prices occurs mostly post-announcement of the station locations. Meanwhile, investors should be wary of the allure of new (uncompleted) builds and proximity to popular schools, as they may not represent value in the property market. Based on the analysis, retail investors can also better estimate the price premium they should be willing to pay for desired property attributes.
